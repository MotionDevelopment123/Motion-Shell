# Motion-Shell

Motion-Shell is a replacement shell tool aimed at turning Windows into a expierance closer to a gaming console.

#### Shell options currently available:
- Steam
  - Starts Steam in the new deck like full screen mode and opens the Windows Shell once closed
- Playnite.
 - Starts Playnite in fullscreen mode with a splash video of choice shown, when switching to desktop mode or closing Playnite the Windows-Shell is launched and closed again if you return to Fullscreen mode
 - Playnite without a splash video (Installs same files as the Splash version to allow easy switching between the 2 but if set to be without the Splash video, the Playnite.exe is set directly as the Shell program).

This is a Beta release, some features are missing such as:
- ~~Uninstaller~~ Initial version included with beta 3
- Settings

May look at implementing an updater in a future release
